# Kani clothing shop

This is a personal project aimed at practicing HTML, CSS, and JS. To create it, I have based it on the website of an online store called [Algo Bonito](https://algo-bonito.com/).

## Getting Started

Below, you will find instructions on how to open the website.

### Prerequisites

- A web browser.

### Installing

1. ```
   git clone https://github.com/Smosherty/kani-website-2
   ```

   or download this repo as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/Smosherty/kani-website-2/archive/master.zip).

2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file and you should have a folder named `kani-website-2-master`

3. Open the folder on your File Explorer and click on the index.html file.
